Working with a React application set up using **Create React App** and managing dependencies with `yarn`. Here's a summary of the key commands:

**`yarn start`**: 
   - Starts the development server and launches the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The app will automatically refresh as you make changes to the code.

**`yarn test`**:
   - Runs the test suite in watch mode, meaning tests will automatically rerun when files are modified. It's ideal for writing and checking unit tests.

**`yarn build`**:
   - Packages and optimizes the app for production, generating minified files that are stored in the `build` folder. This version is optimized for performance in production.
